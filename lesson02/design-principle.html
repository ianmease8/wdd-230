            <h2>White Space</h2>
            <h3>Brigham Young University - Idaho</h3>
            <p><a href="https://www.byui.edu/" target="_blank" >BYUI Home Page</a></p>

            <p>Byu I takes the principle of white space and really applies it to their home page, on this view each picture and paragraph utilize white space to be a delineator between teh sections and the images presented. It also uses white space to form a border around the content to help draw your eyes into the middle of the screen. </p>

            <h2>Repetition</h2>
            <h3>Planet Fitness</h3>
            <p><a href="https://www.planetfitness.com/" target="_blank" > Planet Fitness Home Page</a></p>
            <img src="/lesson02/images/planet-fitness.jpg" alt="planet fitness homepage">
            <p>This screenshot from planet fitness helps to showcase the repetiton and consistency that they have on their page. All the spacing that is present is the same, the images all are the same size. They even use the same color scheme in their images, words and graphics.</p>

            <h2>Contrast</h2>
            <h3>Tesla</h3>
            <p><a href="https://www.tesla.com/powerwall" target="_blank" >Tesla Powerwall</a></p>
            <img src="/lesson02/images/tesla.jpg" alt="Tesla Powerwall">
            <p>This does a really good job at showing a strong contrast. You have a stormy night, its dark its windy and the house is in the center light up. All the words are strikingly white which helps it to stand out and catch your eye. It does a great job of showing contrast </p>
